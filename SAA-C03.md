### Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) ###
- Serverless, fully elastic file storage
- Automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files with no need for management or provisioning.

##  S3 Lifecycle configuration ##
Is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:

### Transition actions ###
- These actions define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them, or archive objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class one year after creating them. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 storage classes.

- There are costs associated with lifecycle transition requests. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.

### Expiration actions ###
- These actions define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.

- Lifecycle expiration costs depend on when you choose to expire objects. For more information, see Expiring objects.

## S3 File Gateway ##

## Amazon CloudFront ##
- Is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

  - If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.

  - If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've definedâ€”such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.

## S3 Intelligent-Tiering ##

- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.
- S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.

## Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive ##
- Is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for long-term retention of data that is rarely accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are acceptable. It is the lowest-cost storage option in Amazon S3, making it a cost-effective choice for storing backup files that are not accessed after 1 month.

## Gateway VPC endpoint ##
- Gateway VPC endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for your VPC. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike other types of VPC endpoints.
- There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.
- Deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges. 
- A gateway VPC endpoint is a network gateway that allows communication between instances in a VPC and a service, such as Amazon S3, without requiring an Internet gateway or a NAT device.
- Data transfer between the VPC and the service through a gateway VPC endpoint is free of charge, while data transfer between the VPC and the Internet through an Internet gateway or NAT device is subject to data transfer charges. By using a gateway VPC endpoint, the company can reduce its data transfer costs by eliminating the need to transfer data through the NAT gateway to access Amazon S3. This option would provide the required connectivity to Amazon S3 and minimize data transfer charges.

## A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service ##
You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances. When you create a NAT gateway, you specify one of the following connectivity types:

- Public â€“ (Default) Instances in private subnets can connect to the internet through a public NAT gateway, but cannot receive unsolicited inbound connections from the internet. You create a public NAT gateway in a public subnet and must associate an elastic IP address with the NAT gateway at creation. You route traffic from the NAT gateway to the internet gateway for the VPC. Alternatively, you can use a public NAT gateway to connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network. In this case, you route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway.

- Private â€“ Instances in private subnets can connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network through a private NAT gateway. You can route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. You cannot associate an elastic IP address with a private NAT gateway. You can attach an internet gateway to a VPC with a private NAT gateway, but if you route traffic from the private NAT gateway to the internet gateway, the internet gateway drops the traffic.

## AWS Direct Connect ##
Is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.

## To prevent or mitigate future accidental deletions, consider the following features ##

- Enable versioning to keep historical versions of an object.
- Enable Cross-Region Replication of objects.
- Enable MFA delete to require multi-factor authentication (MFA) when deleting an object version.

## Amazon Macie ##
Is a data security service that discovers sensitive data using machine learning and pattern matching, provides visibility into data security risks, and enables automated protection against those risks.

## Patch Manager ##
The primary focus of Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, is on installing operating systems security-related updates on managed nodes. By default, Patch Manager doesn't install all available patches, but rather a smaller set of patches focused on security.
